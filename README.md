WHAT: 
This is a Chrome browser extension that replaces the word "tariff" with the phrase "indirect tax that Americans will have to pay on things they consume"

WHY:
For fun.

HOW:
To install this extension in your Chrome browser, follow these steps:

1. Download this git repository to your computer by clicking "Clone or Download" and then "Download ZIP." 
2. Unzip/extract the ZIP on your computer.
3. Go to this URL in your Chrome browser: [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Click to check the box for "Developer mode."
5. One of the new buttons that should appear is "Load unpacked extension." Click it. 
6. Choose the folder that the unzipped/extracted files are in (probably called "blockchain-to-spreadsheet-master").
7. The extension should now appear and the "Enabled" box should be checked. Start browsing blockchain news to read about all the things a giant Excel spreadsheet can do!
